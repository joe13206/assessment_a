		<p>Computer science and programming allows us to create tools to combat different problems. Different languages are specialised in different tasks. Programming languages can be insanely easy to understand, these are called high level languages, and more difficult to understand, known as lower level languages. The study of computer science focuses more on the background information of what is happening during code execution rather than the code itself.</p>
