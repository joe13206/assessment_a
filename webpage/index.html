			<p>IDE's differ from text editors by having features that facilitate the process of coding, this includes color coding specific keywords depending on the language, auto correction, tools such as debugging to help identify errors, built in interpreters, and much more!, while text editors simply operate to give the user a graphical user interface to edit and interact with text, making IDEs the best option with regard to writing code</p>
